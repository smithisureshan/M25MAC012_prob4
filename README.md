The aim of this problem is to design a classifier that reads text documents and classify it into Sports or Politics using TF-IDF for feature extraction and Machine Learning models for classification. We used 20 Newsgroups corpus imported from fetch_20newsgroups and then split into training and test subsets. The dataset consists of 4618 documents with 2625 as Politics and 1993 as Sports. We have used two sports newsgroups and three politics newsgroups. Binary label makes it easy to classify so we labelled 0 for Sports and 1 for Politics.
